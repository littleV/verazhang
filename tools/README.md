# Free Artist Tools

I'm an artist, I paint with my feelings.

I'm a programmer, I know there is a theory behind everything.

Like using color theory to mix colors.

Like using math to generate images.

I believe that, there's never a problem that can't be solved, if you use the right tool. 

Only thing is that the right tool might not be invented yet.

So I built this site.

To inventors,
