We have varied cuisines like mughali, rajasthani, sindhi, gujrati, south- indian, Punjabi, Bengali and a lot more. Delhi being the capital of the state serves you all the cuisines in one, but ssshhh… forget this and give a try to the street food of the city and your taste buds will thank you. Agra on the other hand is famous for its sweet dish named, pethas, which come in a number of flavours like Pan, rose, saffron and many more. Jaipur has in stored for us the great taste of the Rajasthani dishes. Do not miss the ‘daal baati churma’ and ‘balushahi’. Visit India and gain some pounds with the tasty food we have to offer.</p>
      <h4>BLEND OF MODERNITY AND HISTORICITY</h4>
      <p>India yet considered in the list of developing countries is showing its rapid growth with the tall buildings, smooth roads, schools, colleges and what not. These cities prove to be the perfect blend of modernity and historicity with monuments, forts and old heritage properties. As they say, “blend the two goods to make the best” these two are a perfect blend, which makes a place easily accessible and fun to live in.</p>
      <p>Tourists love these cities because the people living locally in these towns understand what a tourist is saying and can help them, plus who doesn’t like to visit the beauties of the past.</p>

These three cities will give us a tickle of cultures and religions like Hindu culture, Marwari culture, Islamic culture, Punjabi culture, rajasthani culture and a few more. We will be seeing the monuments and pilgrimage centres from all the cultural background in these cities, taste the food from different culture. When you come for a golden triangle tour, you will be tickled with different values and cultures all together in a secular India.</p>
